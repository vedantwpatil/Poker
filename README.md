# Poker

Writing a simulation of the Texas Hold'em addition of poker and simulated various playstyles against each other to test which is the most affective

## Poker play styles

Tight Passive
Loose Passive
Tight Aggressive (TAG)
Loose Aggressive (LAG)

## Current Tasks

Right now I'm still building out the general simulation and still unsure if I want to create a gui and make it an entire poker experience or just play it in the terminal and use it for primarily simulating poker playstyles with all the AI playing against each other.
